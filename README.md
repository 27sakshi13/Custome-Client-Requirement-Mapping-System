# Sales & Client Requirement Mapping System Using Power BI and SQL


### Problem Statement

The core problem addressed is the inefficiency and potential for error within the pre-sales process. The pre-sales team often faced challenges in accurately and quickly mapping complex client requirements to specific product features. This disconnect led to delays in generating proposals, a longer sales cycle, and an increased risk of inaccuracies, ultimately impacting team efficiency and operational costs.

### Solution

To address these challenges, a comprehensive Sales & Client Requirement Mapping System was designed and developed using SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The system systematically captures, analyzes, and maps client requirements against available product features.

SQL forms the backbone of the system, housing the product and client data and running the core logic to match requirements to features. Power BI provides an interactive dashboard for the pre-sales team, allowing them to visualize the mapping, quickly identify the best-fit products, and generate accurate proposal data. This system automates a significant portion of the manual matching process, minimizing errors and accelerating the entire sales cycle.

This system is projected to deliver significant business value by enhancing the pre-sales workflow.

  * Cost & Efficiency: Implementation is projected to deliver up to a 30% cost reduction and a 25% increase in team efficiency through automation and error minimization.

   * Accuracy & Speed: The system helps the pre-sales team improve proposal accuracy and significantly shorten the sales cycle. 

### Repository Contents
This repository contains the core components of the mapping system:

* SQL Schema/Dump: The SQL files for creating the database schema required to store product features and client requirements.

* SQL Queries: Key queries used for performing the analysis and mapping logic that powers the system.

* Power BI Project File (.pbix): The Power BI report that serves as the interactive dashboard for the pre-sales team. It includes visualizations for:

         * Client Requirement Input & Analysis

        * Product Feature Mapping

        * Proposal Generation Support

This project demonstrates proficiency in database design, advanced SQL querying, and creating impactful business intelligence solutions with Power BI. The system provides a powerful tool to bridge the gap between client needs and product capabilities, facilitating data-driven decision-making in the sales process.

Feel free to explore the project, use the provided scripts and queries, and adapt the system's logic for similar requirement-mapping challenges.
